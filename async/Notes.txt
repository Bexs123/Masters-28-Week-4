Synchronous means one thing at a time in order.

In JavaScript, Synchronous refers to our code executing one thing at a time.
So the program waits until the current function has finished before moving on to the next.

Asynchronous
Asynchronous refers to the code not having to wait until a function has finished, before moving on to the next.

JavaScript is a single threaded language. Which means it only has one call stack.

Asynchronous JavaScript allows us to carry on down the call stack, without getting blocked by a slow function.

Web APIs allow us to do additional stuff that isn't part of the JavaScript language. Code calls an API,
which can do something and provide a response.

setTimeOut is actully part of a web API provided by the browser. It is not part of the JavaScript language.

setTimeOut where used to simulate the idea that some functions take time to complete.

When functions take time, we need ways to handle them so our code doesn't have to wait.
